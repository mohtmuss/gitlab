    </ul>

    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>TO MAKE THE BIGA:
            <ul>
                <li>At least 1 day before cooking the muffins, combine the flour, water, and yeast in a small bowl to make a sticky dough.</li>
                <li>Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours. The biga will rise slightly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>TO MAKE THE DOUGH:
            <ul>
                <li>Combine the biga, water, yeast, olive oil, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
                <li>Affix the bowl to the mixer and fit with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until the mixture looks creamy, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Mix in 3 cups/435 g of the flour to make a soft, sticky dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>KNEADING THE DOUGH:
            <ul>
                <li>Mix in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough that barely cleans the mixer bowl.</li>
                <li>Replace the paddle with the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface to check its texture. It should feel tacky but not stick to the work surface.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>SHAPING THE DOUGH:
            <ul>
                <li>Shape the dough into a ball.</li>
                <li>Oil a medium bowl. Put the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil, leaving the dough smooth-side up.</li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until almost doubled in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>RISING THE DOUGH:
            <ul>
                <li>Using a bowl scraper, scrape the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut into twelve equal pieces. Shape each into a 4-inch round.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle an even layer of cornmeal over a sheet pan and place the rounds on the cornmeal about 1 inch apart.</li>
                <li>Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for about 1 hour.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>COOKING THE MUFFINS:
            <ul>
                <li>Melt 2 Tbsp of the clarified butter in a skillet over medium heat until melted and hot, but not smoking.</li>
                <li>In batches, add the dough rounds to the skillet. Cook for about 6 minutes per side until browned and puffed.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a paper towelâ€“lined pan and let cool for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>REHEATING THE MUFFINS:
            <ul>
                <li>Split each muffin in half horizontally with a serrated knife.</li>
                <li>Toast in a broiler or toaster oven until lightly browned. Serve hot.</li>
                <li>(The muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
