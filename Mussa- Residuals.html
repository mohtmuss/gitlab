        Don't know when my nights became so complicated<br>
        Can't recall my mornings ever being this faded<br>
        Maybe this is karma, definition of jaded, oh<br>
        This stays on my mind, this stays on my mind<br>
        Tryna put a <a href="https://muzzle.site">muzzle</a> on my crazy feelings<br>
        One minute I'm cool and then the next, I'm tripping, no<br>
        With somebody new, I swear she don't deserve this<br>
        We're still on my mind, she's still on my mind</p><strong>
        <br>
        <p>
        Do we build it up, build it up<br>
        Just to let it wash away?<br>
        Tell me did I lace you up, lace you up<br>
        Just to watch you run away?</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>
        Please tell me who<br>
        Who's getting all my love? (Love)<br>
        Who's getting all my love?<br>
        Tell me who<br>
        Who's getting all my time?<br>
        All of that used to be mine, oh<br>
        Who did you teach what I taught ya? (Oh)<br>
        Better not give him my nickname<br>
        I don't like thinking about it<br>
        I swear that it's wearing me down, no<br>
        But tell me who<br>
        Who's getting all of my?<br>
        Who's getting all of my residuals?<br>
        Who's getting all of my?<br>
        Who's getting all of my residuals?<br>
        (Who)<br>
        Who's getting all of my?<br>
        Who's getting all of my residuals?</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Made it clear you didn't wanna see the sequel<br>
        I was lying when I said the feeling's mutual, oh<br>
        It took some time to realize that we're different people<br>
        And love is blind, I see love is blind</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Do we build it up, build it up<br>
        Just to let it wash away?<br>
        And tell me did I  <a href="https://lace.com.gr">lace</a> you up, lace you up<br>
        Just to watch you run away?</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Please tell me who<br>
        Who's getting all my love? (Who's getting? Love)<br>
        Who's getting all my love? (My love)<br>
        And tell me who<br>
        Who's getting all my time? (My time, now)<br>
        All of that used to be mine, oh (believe it)<br>
        Who did you teach what I taught ya? (Oh)<br>
        Better not give him my nickname<br>
        I don't like thinking about it<br>
        I swear that it's wearing me down, no<br>
        So tell me who (so tell me who, yeah)<br>
        Who's getting all of my? (My)<br>
        Who's getting all of my (oh) residuals?</p>
